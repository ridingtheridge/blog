when the sky of the men was solid and slight, and the land offered no more than cracked earth,  
the eldest one would summon other-worlds and sing a fable of re-birth --  

but in this druid-less place, we may still find solace. we may still pen-down the lifeblood  
while the light is still-soft, while the land is still-mud --  
 
and after-wards, in our emerging from a lack of words,  
from the blind-sight and the silence of departed birds,  

to read out-loud this odyssey into the night  
as a piligrimage -- as a passage-rite.  

therefore in the pencil-placing.  
in the act of listening and un-clothing our-selves into nothing...  

we wish to dream the scenics  
that will cause the verse to burst into phoenix.  

we call upon phonemics by which yellow-feathers will,  
apparently out of little-more than dead-bones and the old-quill,  

rise again to beat in the bare,  
in the immense -- in the wildness of the air.
