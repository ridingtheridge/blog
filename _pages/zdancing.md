<!-- *The purpose of dancing.* -->

<!-- Below you will find a list of blog posts related to dancing. -->

<!-- Sometimes I like to dance. I usually start with a sensation, or a feeling, or a part of the body I am trying to listen to better, and see where it takes me. Sometimes people ask me to share these little dances with them. I don't have Instagram, and I'm all against the 2D flatness of it, but sometimes it's good to let go and just share things you enjoy doing with others. -->
